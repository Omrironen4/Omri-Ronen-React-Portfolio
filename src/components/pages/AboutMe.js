                        name is Omri! I am a full
                        stack web devleoper with a
                        deep a passion for science,
                        and a deep connection with
                        nature. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Health Administration in 2020. During the years of my Bachelor's degree I studied various kinds of sciences, math, and business related courses. 
                        Once Covid-19 spread around the world, I began to reshape my career path. My goal was to work in an industry with a growing employment rate and high demand. Through my peer's advice, I began studying web development and loved it. Shortly after I signed up for a coding bootcamp.
                        Now, I am a recent coding bootcamp graduate from the University of California in Irvine. The bootcamp was 6 months of continuous hands on coding in both front-end and back-end technologies. I created many progressive and responsive web applications with cutting edge technologies. I learned the ins and outs of building applications from scratch, and now I feel ready to begin my journey with a company that allows me to grow and perform.
